	<p>This is a list of projects I have worked on. Most have been completed in my free time. More details about <br> any of the projects can be found in the README.md files of their GitHub repos. My email address is provided on my resume - if you have any questions, comments, or otherwise want to get in touch, I would be happy to hear from you.</p>
	<h3>Projects:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>ErgCalc</li>
		<ul class="top-level-ul">
			<li>iOS app that allows users to convert ergometer data between various formats. Originally designed for personal use after finding existing solutions lacking. </li>
			<li class="no-bullet"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ergcalc-split-calculator/id1200730700?mt=8" style="display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/assets/shared/badges/en-us/appstore-sm.svg) no-repeat;width:78px;height:19px;background-size:cover;margin:1"></a>

			</li>
		</ul>
		
		<li>Snap Text Effects</li>
		<ul class="top-level-ul">
			<li>iOS app that allows users to create text with gradients or rainbows for use in Snapchat. This application became quite popular after being featured on a number of videos. It is currently on around 70,000 lifetime downloads. This app relied on a quirk in how Snapchat handles pasted text, which I believe has now been patched in later updates. As such, I have removed this app from the App Store as of March 2018. </li>

		</ul>
		
		<li>Computing Topics Project</li>
		<ul class="top-level-ul">
			<li>First year project for Computing Topics 164. The project involved creating an informative webpage
				about a particular topic in Computer Science.
				Our project focused on In-Memory Database Systems, and in particular
				programming techniques to optimise their performance. I led this group project and did most of the web design.

		<li>Row Around The World</li>
		<ul class="top-level-ul">
			<li>A web app which allows users to visualise how many meters they are rowing on a world map. Start and end markers can be set, and then meters rowed can be entered. This was created in order to make long erg sessions (slightly) less monotonous.</li>

		<li>Green &amp; Jenks Point-Of-Sale System</li>
		<ul class="top-level-ul">
			<li>A proof-of-concept till system designed for a local ice cream shop. The till system had a fully featured GUI with a number of more advanced features, such as the ability to dynamically add new item buttons and change prices. The project makes use of a database to store item data, and uses some more advanced features of VB like generic types.</li>

		<ul class="top-level-ul">
			<li>A clone of voler.io, built from scratch using node.js. Voler.io was an online multiplayer game in which each player plays as a rocket orbiting a planet. Players must adjust their thrust so that they avoid other players and the planet. Currently a work in progress.</li>
